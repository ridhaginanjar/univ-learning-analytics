# univ-learning-analytics

## Objective
This project is used for learning analytics using "Open University Learning Analytics dataset".

## About dataset
Open University Learning Analytics Dataset contains data about courses, students and their interactions with Virtual 
Learning Environment for seven selected courses and more than 30000 students.

## List of problems
1. Predicting Student Dropout Rates:
   - Problem: Identify students at risk of dropping out before they actually do.
   - Approach: Use machine learning models to predict dropout likelihood based on historical engagement, assignment submission patterns, and quiz performance.
2. Improving Course Design:
   - Problem: Determine which aspects of the course materials contribute to student success or failure.
   - Approach: Analyze student feedback, engagement metrics, and assessment scores to identify which resources are most effective.
3. Personalizing Learning Experiences:
   - Problem: Tailor learning experiences to meet the needs of individual students.
   - Approach: Create recommendations for additional resources or interventions based on a studentâ€™s activity and performance data.
4. Identifying Factors Influencing Performance:
   - Problem: Understand the key factors that contribute to student performance.
   - Approach: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between various features, such as interaction frequency, content type, and grades.
5. Assessing the Impact of Engagement:
   - Problem: Evaluate how different levels of engagement correlate with academic success.
   - Approach: Analyze engagement metrics (e.g., forum posts, video views) alongside academic performance to quantify their impact.
6. Detecting Learning Pathways:
   - Problem: Identify common pathways or trajectories students take through courses.
   - Approach: Use clustering techniques to categorize student behaviors and identify patterns in course navigation.
7. Evaluating Support Interventions:
   - Problem: Assess the effectiveness of academic support interventions (e.g., tutoring, counseling).
   - Approach: Compare performance metrics before and after the implementation of support services to gauge their impact.
8. Time Series Analysis of Engagement:
   - Problem: Explore how student engagement varies over time and in response to course events.
   - Approach: Use time series analysis to examine trends in engagement data, identifying peaks and drops that correlate with course activities.
9. Course Completion Prediction:
   - Problem: Predict which students are likely to complete a course based on early engagement metrics.
   - Approach: Develop classification models using features such as assignment submission rates, forum participation, and quiz scores to forecast course completion.
10. Identifying Effective Learning Strategies:
    - Problem: Determine which study habits or learning strategies lead to better academic outcomes.
    - Approach: Analyze the correlation between various types of engagement (e.g., video watching, reading materials, discussions) and students' final grades to identify effective strategies.
11. Impact of Course Length and Difficulty:
    - Problem: Evaluate how the length and difficulty of courses affect student success rates.
    - Approach: Analyze completion rates and performance metrics in relation to course attributes like duration, complexity, and type of assessments.
